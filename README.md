# Ardent Collector

## About this software

The Ardent Collector saves data submitted to the Elite Dangerous Data Network.

It contains details for over 100,000,000 star systems and millions of buy and 
sell orders for trade commodities traded in stations, ports and carriers 
throughout the galaxy.

The Ardent Collector writes data it gathers to relational databases and
periodically generates reports from the data (e.g. trade reports and summaries
of commodity supply and demand).

The data collected can be accessed by the 
[Ardent API](https://github.com/iaincollins/ardent-api).
