# Ardent Collector

## About this software

The Ardent Collector saves data submitted to the Elite Dangerous Data Network 
(EDDN).

It contains details for over 100,000,000 star systems and millions of buy and 
sell orders for trade commodities sold in stations, ports and on carriers 
throughout the galaxy.

The Ardent Collector writes data it gathers to relational databases and
periodically generates reports from the data (e.g. trade reports).

Data collected can be accessed by the Ardent API, a seperate service that
provides read-only access to the data via a REST API via a global
Content Distribution Network.
