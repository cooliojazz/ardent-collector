# Ardent Collector

## About this software

The Ardent Collector saves data submitted to the Elite Dangerous Data Network.

It contains details for over 100,000,000 star systems and over 10,000,000 trade
orders for commodities traded in stations, ports and in fleet carriers 
throughout the galaxy.

The Ardent Collector writes data it gathers to relational databases and 
generates reports from the data (e.g. summaries of commodity supply and demand 
and trade reports for different regions).

The data collected can be accessed by the 
[Ardent API](https://github.com/iaincollins/ardent-api).
